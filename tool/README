===  Baffle ==

Baffle is a tool for actively fingerprinting and identifying wireless devices.
See ./tool --help for options.

== Compiling ==

Because we need to be able to sniff and inject arbitrary 802.11 packets, we
need help from a few C-libraries (see Depedencies). Before running Baffle,
you must compile the Ruby extensions wrapping these libraries. Generally, it
it done in the following manner:

  ruby extconf
  make
  
You will need to run these commands in:
  
  - ./capture/
  - ./ruby-lorcon/

Once those dependencies are met, everything should work fine.

TODO: Add blurb about installing linalg since it depends on something I cannot
current get working on my machine.

== Depedencies ==

  C-libraries
  - lorcon
  - libpcap
  
  Ruby libraries
  - linalg
